1) Where are the robots
- when i saw the title it was preety clear to me it had something to do with robots.txt
- i took a look inside it and saw User-agent: *Disallow: /cc6b1.html
- if the creators don't want bots to sniff around the given file it probably has a flag in it
- i typed the files name and found the flag which was this: picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_cc6b1}
