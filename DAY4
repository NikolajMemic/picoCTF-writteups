1) Where are the robots
- when i saw the title it was preety clear to me it had something to do with robots.txt
- i took a look inside it and saw User-agent: *Disallow: /cc6b1.html
- if the creators don't want bots to sniff around the given file it probably has a flag in it
- i typed the files name and found the flag
//
- flag: picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_cc6b1}

2) GET aHEAD 
- i inspected the webpage and found nothing special
- after i checked what happens when i add a flag value in request and didn't get anything valuable
- after a while of screwing around with burpsuite and logs i asked gemini for a push and learned there was more methods than just get and post
- after that i used a command curl -I url for which outputed all of the headers where the flag was hiding
//
i learned:
- theres more methods then just get and post
- i learnt to use the command curl for seing the headers of a webpage
- get and head can have diffrent outputs with headers depends on what you code it to answer
// 
- flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_8b13f07}

3) dont-use-client-side (Worst of the day)
- i inspected the page and found suspicius function verify 
- it looked like that: if (checkpass.substring(split*6, split*7) == 'eb02') but for all of the segments
- i arranged them in order and got the flag out of it
- didn't learn anything
//
- flag: picoCTF{no_clients_plz_2eb02b45}

4) Scavanger hunt (Daily favourite)
- i inspected the source of a page and found 1 5th of flag
- 2nd fragment was in a css file
- in js file was a hint on how to prevent google from indexing their website, i knew it was the robots.txt and got the 3rd fragment and a further hint server was on apache
- tried the classic /admin but no luck, since that was all i knew about exploiting apache i asked gemini about the classic exploits of apache server and got informed about .htaccess file
- i didn't check it right off because something else caught my eye i saw something about gobuster and read what it was so for fun i tried discovering all directories where flag could be and it lead me to .htaccess file
- in the .htaccess file i found my 4th fragment and a hint about user using mac, since i had no clue about why that would matter i researched and found out that if apache is running on mac it isnt case sensitive and that theres a file named .DS_Store
- i checked the .DS_Store and found my last fragment there
// 
i learned:
- how to use the gobuster tool
- about .htaccess and .DS_Store files
- its important what your webserver your site is running on and what OS you have server on
//
- flag: picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_9588550}

5) Cookies
- went to storage to check if theres anything under cookies section, found a value that was -1
- after that i typed a placeholder value to see what happens and cookie value changed from -1 to 0
- i went to burpsuite to alter the header named cookie to 1 and the website loaded with chocolate chip cookies, that meant i could access diffrent pages with diffrent values in the given header
- when i entered value 18 i saw the flag page appear
//
i learned: 
- you don't need burpsuite to change cookie value 
//
- flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a4dadb49}
