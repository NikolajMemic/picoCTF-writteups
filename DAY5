1) strings it
- i downloaded the file and used strings command along with grep to filter for picoCTF
// 
- command: strings strings | grep 'picoCTF'
//
- flag: picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_47948C73}
//
learned nothing but it was a great warmup

2)First grep (it wasnt)
- same as 1st one just wanted to get this one out of the way
//
- flag: picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_29f42460}

3)Wave a flag
- description said that the file had useful information
- i installed the file, gave it permision for executing and executed it
- after that it said that -h is used to get help
- after running ./warm -h i got the flag
//
- commands used: 
      - chmod + x warm
      - ./warm
      - ./warm -h
//
- flag: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_ac5832c}
//
- i learned that ./file exectues the file

4) what's a net cat
- description of the problem told me to use netcat to access the flag at a specific port
- i typed the nc command and got the flag
//
- command i used: nc fickle-tempest.picoctf.net 54613
//
- what i learned:
      - i learned how to connect to a port on a server with netcat
      - learned that netcat exists and is a super usefull networking tool
//
- flag: picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_5BBB6400} 

5) nice netcat
- description told me to nc to the given url
- when i did it spat out some numbers that were between 10 and 130 
- i had already worked with ascii so i knew it had to do with it so i converted the base10 to ascii and got the flag
//
- command i used: nc fickle-tempest.picoctf.net 54749
//
- flag: picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_195fe}
