Started using kali

1) Heap Dump
- found the API docs section and looked at API documentation
- saw heapdump section, clicked on it and downloaded the snapshot 
- after doing so i used strings command along with grep to filter for the flag string 

2) Logon(Daily favourite)
- Entered the Joe with random password and got to another page named login but without a flag
- Went to see if there is any extra parameters under cookies and saw admin set to false
- intercepted a package with burpsuite and added admin = true and got in

3)  Inspector
- i inspected the source code and found 1rd of the flag in html 2nd one in css and last 3rd in js file
