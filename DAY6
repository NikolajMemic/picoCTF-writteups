1) Tab, Tab, Attack
- i downloaded a zip file and unziped it
- i saw a directory and went in there, there were directories inside directories so i just kept pressing tab
- when i came to last directory i exectued afile within it and got the flag
//
- commands used:
  -unzip
  -cd 
  ./
//
- flag: picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_fc588427}

2) Static isn't alaways noise
- i was given 2 files so i downloaded both of them
- one was .sh other was a binary executable file, though i found the file with just the cat command i still wanted to solve the challange the intended way
- i gave permision x to the .sh file and ran it with target file being static 
- after i did it i got 2 extra files in my directory
- fles were: static.ltdis.x86_64.txt and static.ltdis.strings.txt
- i found the flag in strings.txt with cat, could have also used strings with grep
- flag was on the adress 0x3020
//
- commands i used:
  -cat
  -chmod + x
  - ./file.sh targetfile
//
- what i learned: 
  - i learned what binary executable looks like
  - i learned that you can reverse it into disasembled binary executable aka assembly
  - the .txt file i recived looked like adresses in memmory and what they referenced
//
- flag: picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_20335e41} 
// 
- comment: Found this challange fun and usefull, it introduced me to reverse engineering and assembly

3) Magikarp Ground Mission
