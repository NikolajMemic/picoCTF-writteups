1) Bookmarklet
- i learned that you can execute js code instead of pasting a link
- since it didn't let me execute it in browser i learnt that a console exists on web tools

2) Includes
- one of the worse challanges so far... half a flag was in index and half of it was in js script
- it was explaining what Includes is (content of file 2 being inserted into file 1) yet solution was to just check the external files, i probably missed the point here

3) SSTI1
- first CTF that i had to look up a solution for since i didn't know what to insert after i learnt what SSTI was
- probably should've learnt how to recognise the language behind the server and how to make a fitting payload 
- at the very least i know what a SSTI is now 

4) Cookie Monster Secret Recipe
- had to inspect the page for cookies and decode a base64 string for flag
- not a hard challange overall
